## General Info

"Guess My Number" is a game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 20. Your task is to guess the number. If your guess is too high or too low, the game will give you a hint. You keep guessing until you find the right number. The game keeps track of your score and high score. Can you guess the number in the fewest possible attempts?

## Technologies

- HTML5

## Game Rules

1. The computer generates a random number between 1 and 20.
2. You enter your guess into the input field and press the 'Check' button.
3. If your guess is too high or too low, the game will give you a hint, and your score decreases by one.
4. If your guess is correct, you win the game, your highscore updates (if this score is higher than the current highscore), and the secret number is displayed.
5. You can play the game again by clicking the 'Again' button. The score and secret number will reset, but the highscore will remain.

Enjoy the game!
